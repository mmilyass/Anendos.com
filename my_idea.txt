Demographics: The brand appeals to very affluent, career-oriented adults (roughly ages 30–55) – essentially Millennials and Gen X in their peak-earning years. These consumers are typically high-income professionals (CEOs, entrepreneurs, executives, top lawyers/doctors) living in major luxury hubs (New York, Paris, Dubai, etc.)

mediaboom.com
. They have substantial disposable income and expect premium quality (as one luxury marketer notes, “luxury consumers often have high disposable income”
mediaboom.com
). Both men and women are targeted: for example, recent data finds affluent men (30–49) embracing niche artisanal fragrances and professional women in their 30s–50s favoring sophisticated signature scents

. In lifestyle they are cosmopolitan and experience-driven – frequent travelers, fine-dining and culture enthusiasts, and digital-savvy consumers comfortable buying luxury online.

Age: Primarily 30–55 (Millennials and Gen X)

freeyourself.com
. Younger affluent buyers seek innovation; older buyers value heritage

.

Gender: Both men and women. (Luxury fragrances often have unisex or gender-specific premium lines; the key is they value power and status in a scent.)

Income/Occupation: Very high earners – e.g. CEOs, entrepreneurs, investment bankers, physicians, lawyers – with annual incomes well above six figures

.

Location: Urban, upscale markets. Major cities and global luxury hubs (e.g. NYC, London, Dubai, Hong Kong)
mediaboom.com
.

Lifestyle: Jet-setters and executives. They enjoy luxury travel, exclusive clubs/events, fine dining and art. They follow high-end media and engage in networking – consistent with elite lifestyles.

Psychographics & Motivations: This audience is self-assured, ambitious and status-oriented. They value power, authority and excellence, and see luxury goods as markers of success

mediaboom.com
. They aspire to leadership and respect, wanting to “feel affirmed, powerful, and respected” by what they own
bethanyworks.com
. They pride themselves on discerning taste – passionate about craftsmanship and exclusivity
mediaboom.com

 – and they project confidence and charisma. Perfume is viewed as a personal signature or “badge of distinction” that signals one’s status. Key motivations include self-expression of success and maintaining an aura of command: purchasing a high-end niche scent serves as a reward for achievement and a statement of identity. These customers are deliberate shoppers – they research products thoroughly and prefer brands with deep stories or heritage. They respond to bespoke experiences (customization, limited editions) that reinforce exclusivity

. In short, they buy prestige: they want a scent that no one else has, that underscores their unique standing and ambition.

Values/Aspirations: Leadership, prestige, exclusivity and excellence
ramotion.com
bethanyworks.com
. They prize products that embody power and high status (luxury is equated with success).

Personality: Self-confident, assertive, discerning and ambitious

. They uphold high standards for themselves and their possessions.

Lifestyle: Upscale, fast-paced, achievement-oriented. Frequent international travel and fine experiences signal their success. (They often use concierge or VIP services for travel/entertainment
vogue.com
.)

Buying Behavior: Brand-loyal but selective. Influenced by storytelling and prestige: for example, they appreciate online narratives showcasing craftsmanship
bfuturist.com
mediaboom.com
. They follow niche influencers or luxury publications rather than mainstream ads. They value personalized service – for example, custom engraving or exclusive launch events – aligning with their sense of exclusivity
mediaboom.com
mediaboom.com
.

Motivations: Projecting achievement and confidence. They seek a signature scent that reinforces their elite self-image. (As one marketer notes, brands like Rolex “symbolize status and achievement” – luxury consumers buy them for that reason
mediaboom.com
.) Wearing a niche high-end perfume makes them feel at the top of their game and differentiates them from “the masses.”

Messaging & Visual Strategy

Brand Voice: Use an authoritative, polished tone that speaks directly to elite aspirations
bethanyworks.com
. The language should be articulate and refined (never slangy or casual), conveying confidence without arrogance. Phrases should subtly imply leadership and exclusivity (e.g. “The Scent of Authority”, “Indulge Your Commanding Presence”). As one brand archetype guide advises, communicate with an “air of exclusivity… speaking to the elite”
bethanyworks.com
. Always reinforce that the customer is deserving of the very best (“you are accustomed to excellence…”).

Visual Aesthetics: Adopt a rich, elegant palette. Think dark, moody backgrounds accented with gold or royal purple (colors traditionally associated with power)
bethanyworks.com
. Bottle designs and layouts should be minimalist yet sumptuous (heavy glass, clean lines, metallic accents). Imagery should feature symbols of leadership and opulence: for example, crowns, thrones, a skyline view from a high-rise, or a poised executive in a luxury setting. Avoid bright, youthful motifs or playful colors; instead use sleek, sophisticated graphics that convey maturity and class.

Content Themes: Emphasize exclusivity and craftsmanship. Tell the story behind each fragrance (inspiration, rare ingredients, artisanal process) to build an emotional connection
mediaboom.com
. Highlight any heritage or awards to signal quality. Use “limited edition” or “by invitation only” language – exclusivity is a powerful lure (“own a truly unique scent”
mediaboom.com
). Whenever possible, incorporate subtle references to leadership (e.g. “lead, don’t follow,” “take command of the room”).

Customer Engagement: Offer bespoke touches. Allow customers to personalize their bottle (engraving or custom labels) or to participate in exclusive previews. This caters to their desire for a unique, high-status experience
mediaboom.com
mediaboom.com
. Provide concierge-level service online (e.g. personal scent consultations via video, luxury packaging) to reinforce premium positioning.

Media & Channels: Showcase on platforms befitting their lifestyle. Use Instagram and LinkedIn for targeted storytelling – Instagram can highlight the visual luxury (crafting the narrative around heritage)
bfuturist.com
, while LinkedIn or business publications reinforce the executive persona. Partner with influencers or brand ambassadors who embody the archetype (successful CEOs, fashion icons, even royalty) rather than mass-market celebrities. For example, a review or endorsement by a respected entrepreneur can carry more weight.

Emotional Appeal: Frame the fragrance as a status symbol. Messaging should make the wearer feel aspirational – for instance, “Wear the scent of success” or “For those born to stand out.” Remind them that choosing this brand means joining an exclusive circle of high achievers. (As one guide notes, Ruler archetype customers “desire exclusivity and success” and want to “feel affirmed, powerful, and respected”
bethanyworks.com
.) Every visual and line of copy should reinforce that this perfume is not for the masses, but for a commanding personality.

By aligning all demographics and psychographics with the Ruler archetype, the brand ensures its charisma, confidence, luxury, power and class identity resonates. In practice, this means speaking and showing images that reflect success and authority, using rich colors and motifs of leadership, and offering an exclusive, high-touch online experience. These choices will attract the niche, high-end audience who see luxury perfume as an extension of their powerful personal brand

Clean, corrected brand description (for Anendos)

Here’s a refined version that matches exactly what you want:

Anendos is a luxury-inspired perfume brand for individuals who dress with class and aspire to feel confident, elegant, and charismatic.

It is designed for those who value presence and refinement, and who use fragrance as a tool to elevate their mood, image, and self-assurance.

Anendos is not about status — it is about transformation.
Wearing Anendos is a step toward confidence, elegance, and quiet power.

This avoids saying they are confident — it says they want to feel it.

Your REAL target audience (very clear)
🎯 Who you are targeting NOW

Men (and later women) who:

Dress classy or want to

Care about how they are perceived

Like luxury aesthetics but can’t afford niche originals

Believe perfume changes how they feel

Students, young professionals, ambitious men

People building confidence, not born with it

❌ Who you are NOT targeting (yet)

Ultra-confident elite buyers

Niche perfume collectors

People who buy only originals for status

How Anendos should talk (tone & language)

Use language like:

“Feel confident”

“Step into elegance”

“Enhance your presence”

“Confidence you can wear”

“Luxury that elevates you”

Avoid:

“For powerful leaders”

“For dominant rulers”

“For those who already command the room”

That language comes later, when you create your own original perfume.

Brand archetype adjustment (important)

You said RULER — that’s good, but for now:

Current archetype:

RULER (aspirational)
→ “Become the man with presence”

Future archetype (original perfumes):

PURE RULER
→ “I am the authority”

This is very strategic and shows brand evolution.

Short one-line positioning (you can use everywhere)

Choose one:

“Luxury fragrances for those becoming confident.”

“Elegance and confidence, one fragrance at a time.”

“Dress classy. Smell confident.”

“Luxury-inspired perfumes for elevated presence.”
